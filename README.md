# deep_space_nine_skipper

This project is an idea for skipping the series's intro. 

The goal is to get the arduino to send the fast forward button and the play button to stop, to skip the intro as fast as possible. 


This requires an arduino, and a infered led (With a 220 resistor of course). The arduino does need a supply of power.
