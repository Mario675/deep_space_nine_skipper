Summary: Press a button, and quickly skip through the intro of deep space nine, without a worry.
Consideratons:
    You will have to mesure how fast the dvd is skipping at full speed.
    You will have to mesure how long the intro section is. 
    You will need to figure out how to bring out the section thing.
    
    - You will need to import a libary for reading ir signals, and broadcasting ir signals.
      See arduino video about the libary and remote.
